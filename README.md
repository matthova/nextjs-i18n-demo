# NextJS with i18n

This is my attempt to show a full-stack web app with minimal features for i18n support, via NextJS

The site includes the following

- i18n provided via "next-intl"
- `en` and `es` support
- `en` and `es` custom slug support
- type safe-strings

## Wishlist

- Autogenerated i18n via LLM
- i18n preference selection (with cookie update)
